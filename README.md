automation:
  - alias: "Turn on fan when hot"
    trigger:
      platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.blowcontrol_temperature
      above: 25
    action:
      - service: fan.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: fan.blowcontrol_fan
      - service: fan.set_percentage
        target:
          entity_id: fan.blowcontrol_fan
        data:
          percentage: 75
```

### Scripts

Create scripts for common fan operations:

```yaml
# Night mode script

  night_mode:
    sequence:
      - service: fan.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: fan.blowcontrol_fan
      - service: fan.set_percentage
        target:
          entity_id: fan.blowcontrol_fan
